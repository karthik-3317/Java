Recurrsion - A Function Which Calls Itself Until It Reaches The End Of The Base Case Defined

Traditional way to speak there is a main function and print function the main function wants
to call the print function after completion of the execution it will return back to main 
function this is normal way.
    Now When a function called 'repeat' calls himself it means the description of the repeat function contains the call of the repeat function this will call itself multiple times in others words calling the same function infinte times but it is not the case to comeup with so we want to describe some basic logic in our function description which helps to stop over the repeation for infinte so we introduce a concept called base condition this condition is a technique which is deposited inside our logic of code when the function executes this condition is must checked when the function meets our criteria then we would stop called return our function call as we know there is a stack going to be prepared for each iteration step when ever our cursor points over return this is going to clear all the steps that is presented in the stack by cancelling over them and reach to main function is the topic called Recurrsion

    
When you return back the function called down lines would be executed that's it
